# Welcome to MoRobAE - A Workshop on Mobile Robot Assistants for the Elderly

## ICRA 2019 Edition

All around the world, the increasing size of the senior population combined with
small population growth brings a decline in the number of people of working age
who support the costs of the system, and a lack of resources to treat patients
and to provide quality care.
Mobile robotics is one alternative to address these issues, and is or has been
addressed in large scale initiatives all around the world.

We encourage researchers that want to discuss such projects to partipate in our
workshop, which will be held during **[ICRA 2019](https://icra2019.org) in 
Montréal, Québec, Canada in May 2019**.

To submit your work, please consult our **[Call for participation](/cfp)**.

### Topics

Topics discussed at the workshop will include but are not limited to:

 * Telepresence robotics for remote assistance
 * Robot hardware and software design for seniors
 * Sensing capabilities required for seniors-robot interaction
 * Autonomous decision-making for robot assistants
 * User-centered robot design in a socially and economically responsible fashion
 * Qualitative and quantitative approaches for evaluating the experience and
 impact of robots with seniors

### Proposed Schedule

 * Part 1 (90 min): Presentation of invited talks
 * Part 2 (60 min): Bull session on robot assistants for the elderly
 * Part 3 (30 min): Roadmapping - Gathering ideas on future projects and
                    partnerships
